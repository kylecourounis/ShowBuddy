# ShowBuddy
If you are a musician who uses backing tracks, then **ShowBuddy** is the program for you! 
<br>
**ShowBuddy** allows musicians to play backing tracks in order along with lyrics in an easy-to-use user interface.
## How To Get Started
* Once you've downloaded the program from the Releases page, you'll need to have at least .NET Framework 4.6.2. (If you want to edit the source, you'll need Visual Studio 2017)
* Once you run the program, open up the 'Sets' folder and add your backing tracks in **.wav** format to the 'Songs' folder.
* It's not mandatory, but you can add lyrics as .txt files in the 'Lyrics' folder to have the program print the lyrics as well. (Remember to match the name of the lyric file to the name of your .wav file)
* Then, you can add to the set list by clicking the 'Add' button in the application.

### How to use the add menu
* The song name is the name of the file in the 'Songs' folder **DO NOT ADD .WAV**.
* The delay is the delay before the lyrics are displayed in the box on the right side.
* The lyric delay is the delay between printing each line from the lyrics text file.
##
* To change the order of your set list, select/click one of the songs, and click the up or down button to move it into the desired position.
* Then double click the song to play it!
